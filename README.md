Products like “Amazon Fee,” “Manual,” and “Dotcom Postage” drive most of the revenue. These should be prioritized in marketing and kept well-stocked.

Launch seasonal campaigns like New Year discounts, Valentine’s Day promos, and Spring sales to boost early-year performance. Promote bundled offers or clearance sales on slow-moving items to increase order volume in Q1 and Q2.
